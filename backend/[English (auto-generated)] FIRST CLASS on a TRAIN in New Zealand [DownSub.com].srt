58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
views out the window at this point are

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,360
exactly what you'd expect in New Zealand

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,920
an abundance of sheep and lamb as well

61
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,959
as a few Vineyards which I'm looking

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,599
forward to trying a little later on but

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,560
as comfortable as it is to sit here and

64
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,080
enjoy it all Seb has a better idea all

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,120
right should we check out the deck oh

66
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
yeah oh yeah there's a deck at the back

67
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,080
of the train is an outdoor deck space

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,840
which is great for three reasons one it

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,120
gives you room to walk around and

70
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,760
stretch your legs on board two you can

71
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,920
get some fresh air throughout the day

72
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,640
and three it's better for photos as you

73
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,000
don't get any glare from Windows and you

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
can see the whole train ahead of you as

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,400
we go around corners

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,440
and look at this

77
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,720
backdrop we have only been on the train

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,080
for an hour or so so far and I'm told

79
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,159
it's only going to get better now it's

80
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,080

awesome cool now the trick with these

98
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,159
you have to remember to lock the door

99
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,480
otherwise someone can open it from

100
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,120
outside good this is absolutely huge

101
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,799
it's not that fancy but it

102
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,280
works but I will give them extra credit

103
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,960
cuz I this is the coolest bathroom door

104
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,160

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,440
seeing for the first time the ocean for

110
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,000
the next few hours we'll be running

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,560
along the east coast with ocean views on

112
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
the right hand side while there's still

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
valleys and mountains on our

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,520
left but that's not all there are

115
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,880
tunnels too look at this view look at

116
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,160

118
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,240
oh look at this long tunnel oh there we

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,080
go wow it's like the California

120
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,960
coastline this really is one of those

121
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,400
train rides where you don't know where

122
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,639
to look do you watch the train snake

123
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,560
ahead of you take in the ocean or peek

124
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,759
ahead of the snow capped

125
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,360
mountains luckily this train has it all

126
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,800
so you don't really need to decide oh

127
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,560
it's amazing better than way better than

128
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,520
I thought what a

129
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,400

134
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,720
with this it's quite a few courses on

135
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,360
today's ride but they're all pretty well

136
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,680
spaced apart and I've said this before

137
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
but there really is no better type of

138
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,759
restaurant than one that moves with a

139
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,600
view like this and what a view what a

140
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
restaurant View

141
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,880
now whenever we're able to get out and

142
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,759
stretch our legs for a second I always

143
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,080
like to take advantage of it we've

144
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,160
arrived at a train station we can step

145
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,599
off for a minute but we don't want to go

146
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,800
too far what a

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,000
view we can come out see the front of

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,240

can see this the ocean right there and

150
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,960
the mountains in the background but I

151
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,440
get so anxious that the Train's going to

152
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,479
leave without us so uh I'm just going to

153
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:24,960

Zealand oh my goodness I really don't

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,440

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,720
mountains on one side and ocean on the

168
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,960

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,919
the world you can see all of that in one

171
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,919

172
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,319
I mean it's got everything it's even got

173
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,960
highways we spending more time outside

174
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,800
than on extra seats yeah

175
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,400
yeah that is true we're not spending

176
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,479
much time in our seats at all you pay

177
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,000
for your seats but really all you need

178
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,639
is this outdoor car because this is a

179
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,039
Scenic rail experience we booked it to

180
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,560
see the scenery of New Zealand and it

181
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,240
has absolutely delivered so

182
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,159
far just ignore the crazy wind hair I

183
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:02,720
mean I'm really enjoying it out there

184
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,280
that's the whole point of this so this

185
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,680
is Scenic class and it is very Scenic

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,440
moment but this finic carries about a

368
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,360
million passengers a year and I can see

369
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,800
why it's like really cute do you want

370
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
the do you want the front or the bottom

371
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,120
top or the bottom bottom got it found my

372
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,600
seat

373
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,600
perfect here we go ladies and gentlemen

374
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,839
now the cable car only goes about 18 km

375
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,199
an hour or so we're going to speed it up

376
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,920
in editing here but it does have some

377
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,600
nice murals on the way up and I really

378
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,240
like this tunnel with neon lights that

379
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,639
is cool has disco lights that is cool

380
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,199
I told I told you cable cars are cool

381
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,319
yeah and of course like any finic the

382
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,720
track splits in the middle uhoh uhoh to

383
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,880
let the cable cars pass well we only had

384
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,639
an hour or so to do something before it

385
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,399
closed but worth it yeah Wellington

386
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,360
Cable Car approved and after 2,000 ft we

387
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,240
have arrived at the top of the line it's

388
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,120
like a very slow Scenic roller

389
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,279
coaster well we made it up here just

390
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,440
about it sun set but the sun set's on

391
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,279
the other side but still what a view

392
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,959
yeah and now I can see why it is one of

393
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,600
the most popular attractions here in

394
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,760
Wellington it's very quiet and peaceful

395
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,439
yeah and it reminds me a little bit of

396
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,600
Canada yeah the buildings are a little

397
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,439
different though like it's like a mix of

398
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,199
Canada and San Francisco yeah now the

399
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,319
best part of these types of trips is the

400
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
free time and really not knowing where

401
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,880
you'll end up tonight's choice of

402
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,959
restaurant happens to be over a hundred

403
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,440
years old and has live jazz tonight

404
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,080
[Music]

405
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,240
I'd say exploring Wellington was a

406
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,160
success but we have to get to bed

407
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,039
because we have an early morning train

408
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,080

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,039

don't know when we're going to have time

00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:08,640
to be on the back deck when we're going

say no to

439
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,559
that as long as they're different

440
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,919
temperatures and we're off all right

441
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,440

in 10 hours from now that's right today

444
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,880
will be crossing the entire North Island

445
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,760
and service starts again with a warm tow

446
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,240
o wow thank you so much say it was

447
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,320

away need so we're on our way out of

450
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,679
Wellington past the ferry we rode in on

451
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,600
we're moving now and are very quickly

452
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,039
served our first bit of breakfast Chia

453
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,400
Chia

454
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,080
honey we are about to cross five

455
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,640
viaducts and here's the

456
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,120
first now the spectacular part of

457
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,919
today's journey is the fact that we'll

458
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,960
have a little bit more height than we

459
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,000
did

460
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,679
yesterday

461
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,640
wow and with views like these the

462
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,000
outdoor car at the back is much busier

463
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
today

464
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,600
o r wow

465
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,799
rub that's cool along with viu we also

466
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,919
get to cut through some hillsides with

467
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,280
longer tunnels today

468
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,039
too oh my gosh it's lunchtime

469
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,600
already wow thank you we're having

470
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,840
quinoa salad with

471
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,840
with

472
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,640
lamb I even spotted some Wildlife out

473
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,840
here that's not sheap too

474
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,440
wow some more surprising than

475
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,559
others now I think it's clear today's

476
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,400
landscape is very different from

477
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
yesterdays and it's hard to pick which

478
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,240
one is better but this different Flora

479
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,679
is a sign we've entered the tongariro

480
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,480
National Park which holds perhaps the

481
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,880
most impressive feature of of this trip

482
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,200
oh wow we got a volcano we're cruising

483
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,559
along a volcanic Plateau which is why it

484
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,320
feels suddenly so different to what we

485
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,279
had been seeing but it's not long before

486
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,679
we move from a natural wonder to an

487
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,279
engineering wonder the spiral tunnels

488
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,159
you see those tracks below that's where

489
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,840
we're going to come out so they call us

490
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,919
an engineering Marvel we're about to go

491
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:53,360
around the top of the mountain into a

492
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,919
tunnel come un tunnel underneath where

493
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:59,880
we are right now

494
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,120
and then do a big horseshoe curve and

495
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,240
that is to drop 139 M now I will admit

496
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,080
for most of us you can't actually see

497
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,320
much but occasionally you can spot the

498
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,640
tracks on this spiral

499
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,679
segment we're going to go through two

500
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,159
tunnels a short one now we're going into

501
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,320
the long one with a long

502
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,279
curve W that's cool now we're going

503
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,120
around down and then under right yeah

504
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,840
yeah we're going to come out of the

505
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,600
tunnel underneath where we

506
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,760
started pretty that's a long my tunnel I

507
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,799
guess yeah there there

508
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,880
go and we were up

509
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,320
there this is something you really could

510
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,240
miss if you weren't looking for it but

511
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,360
on a 10-hour train ride you take all the

512
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,640
excitement you can get hold on

513
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,559
that was the tightest corner of our

514
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,440
entire trip yes the little things you

515
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,080
got to you got to enjoy the little

516
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,000
moments on a long train R like this take

517
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
what you get yeah we've got all day yeah

518
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
all right let's go get that cheese

519
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,279
platter oh

yeah oh wow thank you say cheese cheese

521
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
got to say this cheese plate looks

522
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,840
really gooda but uh I've already had it

523
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,559
before so

524
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,760
too cheesy a little

525
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,000
bit little

526
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,559
bit you're spending a lot of time

527
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,279
looking out the windows it's so look at

528
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,960
the landscape now most of the afternoon

529
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,080
is spent in these seats eating more yeah

530
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,159
cheers man cheers hey good trip good

531
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,799
trip thanks so so far good trip yeah

532
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,679
very good trip thanks for coming now I

533
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,520
can say the view has stayed pretty

534
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,320
consistently amazing I mean it has

535
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,240
changed throughout the 2-day journey

536
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,480
which has kept it interesting all the

537
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,559
the way through but I think it's clear

538
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,120
why this is called one of the great

539
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,559
Railway Journeys in New Zealand but

540
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,960
eventually you will notice signs that

541
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,720
we're approaching

542
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,840
civilization which can only mean one

543
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,400
thing I think this is it yeah 10 minutes

544
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,080
Areo and we're in ockland We Made It 2

545
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,120
days from Christ Church to Picton a

546
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,399
fairy to Wellington and the train all

547
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,120
the way to Auckland glad we made it

548
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,039
it's been a long day yes it is it's just

549
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,480
