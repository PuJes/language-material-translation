  🎉 All production environment variables are correctly configured

📋 Test 2: Verifying build output
  ✅ Build output exists
  ✅ index.html generated successfully
  ✅ Assets properly referenced in HTML
  🎉 Build output verification completed

📋 Test 3: Simulating production environment variable loading
  📊 Simulated Production Configuration:
    API URL: https://language-learning-backend.onrender.com
    WebSocket URL: wss://language-learning-backend.onrender.com
    Environment: production
    Timeout: 900000ms
    Retries: 5
    Reconnect Delay: 3000ms
    Max Reconnect Attempts: 10
  ✅ API URL uses HTTPS protocol
  ✅ WebSocket URL uses WSS protocol
  ✅ API URL points to correct Render backend service
  🎉 Production URL validation completed

📋 Test 4: Verifying render.yaml configuration consistency
  ✅ VITE_API_URL found in render.yaml
  ✅ VITE_WS_URL found in render.yaml
  ✅ VITE_APP_ENV found in render.yaml
  ✅ language-learning-backend found in render.yaml
  ✅ language-learning-frontend found in render.yaml
  🎉 render.yaml configuration is consistent
```

### URL Generation Test Results
```
🔍 Verifying Production URL Generation...

📊 Environment Detection:
  Development Mode: false
  Production Mode: true
  Environment: production

🌐 Generated URLs:
  Base API URL: https://language-learning-backend.onrender.com
  WebSocket URL: wss://language-learning-backend.onrender.com
  API Timeout: 900000ms
  API Retries: 5
  WS Reconnect Delay: 3000ms
  WS Max Reconnect Attempts: 10

✅ URL Validation:
  ✅ API URL uses HTTPS
  ✅ WebSocket URL uses WSS
  ✅ API URL points to Render backend
  ✅ WebSocket URL points to Render backend
  ✅ Environment is production
  ✅ Production timeout is configured
  ✅ Production retries are configured

🎯 Summary:
  🎉 All URL validations passed!
