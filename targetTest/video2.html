                So for lunch we stopped into<br>

                Miso-based soup, but it's really all about the noodles.<br>

                they are like an extra thick udon noodle,<br>

                And 'cause it's served in the cast iron <span class="vocab-highlight" data-term="skillet">skillet</span>, they actually give you a little <span class="vocab-highlight" data-term="ladle">ladle</span> to ladle it out of the skillet into a bowl to eat it from.<br>
                I got the one with meat. Ocgirl got the one with mushrooms.<br>
                This is their specialty.<br>
                I really like meat.<br>
                1300 yen each. Pretty cheap.<br>

                as a veggie to go with it.<br>
                If you like veggies, you'll<br>
                definitely love this.<br>
                Particularly the one that has no meat.<br>
                Mm, it's good.<br>

                Mm, I think this is a super good deal<br>
                for like 10 US dollars for these things.<br>
