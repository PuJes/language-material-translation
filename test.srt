58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
views out the window at this point are

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,360
exactly what you'd expect in New Zealand

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,920
an abundance of sheep and lamb as well

61
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,959
as a few Vineyards which I'm looking

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,599
forward to trying a little later on but

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,560
as comfortable as it is to sit here and

64
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,080
enjoy it all Seb has a better idea all

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,120
right should we check out the deck oh

66
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
yeah oh yeah there's a deck at the back

67
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,080
of the train is an outdoor deck space

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,840
which is great for three reasons one it

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,120
gives you room to walk around and

70
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,760
stretch your legs on board two you can

71
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,920
get some fresh air throughout the day

72
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,640
and three it's better for photos as you

73
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,000
don't get any glare from Windows and you

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
can see the whole train ahead of you as

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,400
we go around corners

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,440
and look at this

77
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,720
backdrop we have only been on the train

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,080
for an hour or so so far and I'm told

79
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,159

80
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,080

98
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,159
you have to remember to lock the door

99
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,480
otherwise someone can open it from

100
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,120
outside good this is absolutely huge

101
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,799
it's not that fancy but it

102
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,280
works but I will give them extra credit

103
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,960

104
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,160
